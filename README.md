## Introduction

This repository contains a Taxi Fare System developed in Python. The project is divided into two levels:

1. **Basic Level**: A simple CLI-based system where the user can start a ride, calculate fares for both moving and stationary taxi, and end a ride.
2. **Intermediate Level**: This level adds logging, unit tests, and a history of past trips for enhanced functionality.

The goal is to gradually improve the system, making it more robust and feature-rich.

## üìö Libraries Used
 
The following libraries have been used in this project:

- **time**: To handle time-related operations, like calculating duration.
- **datetime**: For timestamping and date-related functionality.
- **json**: Used for saving and loading configuration data, and storing historical records.
- **os**: For interacting with the operating system, such as creating or managing files.
- **logging**: To implement logging and track system events.
- **pytest**: For running unit tests to ensure code correctness.
- **unittest.mock**: For mocking objects in unit tests.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

### Basic Level
- **`basic/`**: Contains the basic functionality of the Taxi Fare System.
  - **`taximeter_essential_level.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook where the basic CLI functionality is demonstrated.

### Intermediate Level
- **`intermediate/`**: Includes the more advanced features like logging and historical records.
  - **`main_taximeter_intermediate_level.py`**: Python script for handling the core logic of the taxi fare system.
  - **`rates.json`**: JSON file containing the fare configuration.
  - **`logs_ride.log`**: Log file for tracking system events.
  - **`history_ride.json`**: JSON file for storing the historical data of previous rides.

## üü¢ Basic Level

The **Basic Level** contains the essential features of the Taxi Fare System:

1. **Welcome Message**: When the program starts, it will greet the user and provide a brief explanation of how it works.
2. **Start a Ride**: The user can initiate a ride and begin tracking the taxi's movement.
3. **Fare Calculation**:
    - When the taxi is **stationary**, it charges 2 cents per second.
    - When the taxi is **moving**, it charges 5 cents per second.
4. **End the Ride**: When the ride ends, the program will show the total fare in euros.
5. **New Ride**: After completing a ride, the user can start a new ride without closing the program.

## üü° Intermediate Level

The **Intermediate Level** introduces more advanced features to enhance the system:

1. **Logging**: A logging system is added to track various events such as the start and end of rides.
2. **Unit Testing**: Using `pytest` and `unittest.mock`, the code is tested to ensure correctness and reliability.
3. **Historical Records**: All past rides are stored in a JSON file for future reference.
4. **Fare Configuration**: Users can modify fare settings in the `rates.json` file to adapt to demand changes (e.g., peak hours).

## üìçRoadmap

### üîú Future Features (Development Phase)
#### üü† Advanced Level
The **Advanced Level** will introduce the following enhancements to further improve the system:

1. **Refactor Code with OOP**: Refactor the existing code using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to improve maintainability, scalability, and readability.
2. **Authentication System**: Implement a password-based authentication system to protect access to the program, ensuring that only authorized users can use it.
3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a user-friendly graphical interface to make the program more intuitive and accessible.

#### üî¥ Expert Level
The **Expert Level** will take the project to the next level with more advanced features:

1. **Database Integration**: Integrate a database to store and manage historical ride records, improving scalability and data management.
2. **Dockerization**: Dockerize the application to make it easy to deploy and portable across different environments.
3. **Web Application**: Develop a web-based version of the Taxi Fare System, making it accessible via a browser and enabling internet-based access.
